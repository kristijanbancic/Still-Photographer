 Creating Film Still Images
 
 For the past several years, I've been working on films as a freelance Still Photographer. I've worked in many areas as my portfolio will attest to. I'm trying to incorporate old and new photographic techniques to create something unique. Even where it is a dim light, knowing where is light, one can photograph. I am always open and ready for new challenges and opportunities. The desire to achieve successful shooting using every possible tool, to get the final fragment. I consider myself an eternal student of film and photography. Let's talk about what I can do for you? Let me create something great for your film! I'm also active on social media so if you're curious about what I'm up to you can check my work on IMDb. Thanks!
